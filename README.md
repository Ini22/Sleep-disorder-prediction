Project Overview
Sleep health is crucial to overall well-being, and the ability to predict sleep disorders can significantly enhance preventive healthcare. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze a sleep dataset and predict various sleep disorders.

The key objectives are:

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sleep-related data to uncover patterns and insights.
To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict different sleep disorders.
Results
Model Comparison
The models were compared based on their performance across various metrics:

RandomForestClassifier performed best in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
SVC showed high precision but lower recall compared to RandomForest.
KNeighborsClassifier and GaussianNB provided baseline comparisons.
Summary of Findings
Top Model: RandomForestClassifier with an accuracy of 89%, F1-score of 76%.
Key Insights: Factors like sleep duration and efficiency were strong predictors of sleep disorders.
